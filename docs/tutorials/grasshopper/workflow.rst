To build a timber frame **Assembly**, you need to:

*   create **Beams**
*   define **Joints** between these beams
*   define other **Features** (optional)

Based on this, **Assembly** takes care of generating the final geometry of the structure.

.. note::

    **Important!**

    * The order in the list of **Joints** and **Features** matters! For example: if there are two different joints defined for the same pair of beams in the list, the last one will be applied (overrides entries earlier in the list).
    * The **Joints** are processed first, then **Features**.
